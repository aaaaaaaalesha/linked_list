Introduction to Data Structure Linked List from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/linked-list/).

## Introduction

In this card, we are going to introduce another data structure - `Linked List`.

Similar to the array, the **linked** list is also a linear data structure. Here is an example:

As you can see, each element in the linked list is actually a separate object while all the objects are **linked together by the reference field** in each element.

There are two types of linked list: singly linked list and doubly linked list. The example above is a singly linked list and here is an example of doubly linked list:

We will introduce more in later chapters. After this card, you will:

   - Understand the structure of singly linked list and doubly linked list;
   - Implement traversal, insertion, deletion in a singly or doubly linked list;
   - Analyze the complexity of different operations in a singly or doubly linked list;
   - Use two-pointer technique (fast-pointer-slow-pointer technique) in the linked list;
   - Solve classic problems such as reverse a linked list;
   - Analyze the complexity of the algorithms you designed;
   - Accumulate experience in designing and debugging.
